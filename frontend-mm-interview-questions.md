## What is the DOM? 

> Is the HTML you write the DOM? -> No, but the HTML you write is parsed by the browser and turned into the DOM
> Is 'View Source' the DOM? -> View Source just shows you the HTML that makes up that page. Probably the exact HTML that you wrote
> Is the code in DevTools the DOM -> Yes, kinda! When youâ€™re looking at the panel in whatever DevTools you are using that shows you stuff that looks like HTML, that is a visual representation of the DOM

*Definition 1:*

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated

*Definition 2:*

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.


## What are some of the features of ES6?

https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features

*Arrows*

Arrows are a function shorthand using the => syntax. They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both statement block bodies as well as expression bodies which return the value of the expression. Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code.

*Classes*

ES6 classes are a simple sugar over the prototype-based OO pattern. Having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use, and encourages interoperability. Classes support prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance and static methods and constructors.

*Template Strings*
*Destructuring*
*Default + Rest + Spread*
*let + const*

... and more

## What it's this in javascript?

It has different values depending on where it is used:

- Alone, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
- In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.
